      <h1>The history of the lotus flower:</h1>
      <p>Johanna Augusta, a professional numerologist who blogs about <span class="text-decoration-underline">numerology
          and spirituality</span> at <span class="text-decoration-underline">MinistryofNumerology.com</span>, explains
        that the lotus is an ancient symbol of purity, beauty, and spiritual enlightenment. "In Hindu and <span
          class="text-decoration-underline">Buddhist traditions</span>, the lotus is often used as a metaphor for the
        soul's journey toward nirvana," she adds. "Many cultures also associate the lotus flower with the sun and fire
        element."</p>
      <p>It represents purity, spiritual enlightenment, and new beginnings, says Augusta, who has studied the meaning
        and symbolism behind the lotus flower extensively. Augusta's grandmother grew lotuses in her garden, and the
        flower has always been a source of inspiration for her.</p>

          <h1 class="text-center">Lotus flower symbolism across cultures:</h1>
          <p>
            According to <span class="text-decoration-underline">Ms. IGee of Higher Vibes Online</span>, a spiritual
            influencer with specialties in astrology, tarot card reading, crystals, healing, ancestry, and <span
              class="text-decoration-underline">spirit guides</span>, the lotus flower is respected and regarded across
            various Eastern traditions. It's a symbol of royalty and integrity. The lotus, also known as "padma" (a
            nickname in Tibet and Sanskrit), grows naturally, typically in ponds, muddy waters, and other calm bodies of
            water.</p>
          <p>"The sacrality of the lotus flower originated in Vietnam by Buddhist and Hindu culture, and even some
            ancient Chinese cultures," IGee points out. "The sacredness is due to its ability to blossom through scummy
            murky water and evolve itself into a beautiful unique flower," IGee explains. "Due to its beautiful
            transformation under what most consider dire circumstances, the lotus has been long regarded as a symbol of
            purity, resurrection, rebirth, sanity, enlightenment, and triumph over obstacles that most are unable to
            overcome."</p>
          <p>In addition to how the lotus flower is portrayed in Hinduism and Buddhism, in ancient Egyptian culture, the
            lotus was associated with the sun and fire element, while in Chinese culture, it can also represent of
            purity, beauty, and harmonious relationships, says Augusta.

          <h1 class="text-center">Lotus flower meaning in spirituality and religion:</h1>
          <p>To <span class="text-decoration-underline">Linda Lauren</span>, fourth generation psychic medium and
            creator of <span class="text-decoration-underline">The Vibe Spray</span> who specializes in helping clients
            with meditation, Reiki healing and psychic medium services, the lotus flower, in practice, can be connected
            to yoga and <span class="text-decoration-underline">meditation</span>. "The flower grows through the mud,
            and this has been taken to mean that we can rise above our darkest challenges and desperate hours," she
            explains. "So, I have used the flower and its symbol to get to the heart of my inner thoughts and emotions
            during meditation."</p>
          <p>When Lauren discusses the lotus flower in reference to meditation, the image that is thought of is the
            heart of the flower. "The heart within us, can be visualized as a lotus flower unfolding at the center of
            the chest," she adds. "Often, when teaching guided meditation, I use the lotus pedals as a means to enter
            the meditative state of calm."</p>
          <p>IGee reminds that the lotus flower does not have ties to one specific religion or spiritual belief. That's
            what's so great about it. "It is a sacred symbol used to draw inspiration for all people of all
            backgrounds," IGee points out. "The lotus flower should be honored in its natural state but can be uprooted
            and replanted for our personal symbolism that states living life with unwavering faith."</p>

      </div>
      <p>The lotus flower comes in many colors, which come with a different meaning:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="fw-bold"> White : </span> Also considered "womb of the world" (like a baby), the white lotus —
          not to be confused with the popular HBO series — signifies purity, grace, beauty, wealth, knowledge and
          fertility.</li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-bold"> Pink : </span> Typically referenced in Buddhism, the pink lotus symbolizes Buddha's
          earthly symbol. When a pink lotus is a closed bud, it means a spiritual journey. When it's open in bloom, it
          means enlightenment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-bold"> Yellow : </span> A yellow lotus flower symbolizes curiosity, openness, and hospitality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-bold"> Red : </span> A red lotus flower signifies compassion, sympathy, and passion. Think of
          it like a red rose. It's your heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-bold"> Blue : </span> A rare lotus, a blue one of its kind represents wisdom.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-bold"> Purple : </span> Also rare, the purple lotus (often referenced in Buddhism) symbolizes
          balance within yourself, and self-enlightenment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>How to respect the lotus flower</h1>
      <p>As we've said in this story, the lotus is a sacred flower. So, it should be treated with respect and care.
        There are many ways to do this, plus also ways to harness the power and energy of the lotus.</p>
      <p>"One way is to meditate on its symbolism and meaning," Augusta suggests. "Another way is to grow your own lotus
        flowers or even just appreciate them in their natural environment."</p>
      <p>"You can also use the lotus as a symbol of hope and inspiration in your own life," Augusta says. Perhaps you
        can also display the lotus as decor in your home.</p>
      <p>"Finally, you can create art or write poetry inspired by the lotus flower," Augusta explains. "Whatever way you
        choose to connect with the lotus, allow it to be a source of beauty, peace, and spiritual guidance in your
        life."</p>
